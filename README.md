# Breast-Cancer-Cells-Data-Science-Project
# About
For this project, the data I am exploiting is a dataset from the CuMiDa repository
that contains 78 handpicked cancer microarray datasets. In this dataset the main
features are the gene expression levels of 54676 genes in the columns from 151 breast
cancer cell samples in the rows. Furthermore, the five different cancer cells will be
present as well and the target will be the different cancer cells that the amount of genes
are present. The question I want to answer is which cancer cells have the most genes
found in them and which models and neural networks would work best for this dataset.
